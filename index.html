       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <h3>Hi I am Aron</h3>
       <p> I am a very enthusiastic traveller. I have been through many parts of India such as the classic Golden Triangle cities to the relaxing states of Goa and 	Kerala in the south, and Amritsar on the northwest frontier. Many travellers find it hard to choose because India is such a large and culturally diverse 	country and has so many amazing places to visit. I decided one day that I will write about India, travels and holidays in India. </p>
